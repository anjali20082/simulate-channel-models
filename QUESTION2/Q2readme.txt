Rayleigh fading:

Signal is generated using given parameters and Rayleigh distribution used to generate 100 independent sinosoids and they are added with noise to generate received signal, and after that 
SNR of received signal is plotted against time as required. The plot shows no particular trend, just that the SNr varies with respect to time.
