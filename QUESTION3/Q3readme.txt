To calculate latency , The client and server ping an Ntp server with some delay each time to get current time.

Wireless - calculated by connecting client(mobile phone) and server(laptop) to a common broadband connection.

Wired - calculated by connecting phone using usb tethering to laptop. The latency is bit higher than expected probably because the mobile internet connection is not as fast as the broadband but no other options were available.
