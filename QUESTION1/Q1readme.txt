The first three plots i.e. BER versus SNR for BPSK, QPSK and 4QAM are plotted using the theoretical formula as asked in the question.

The next two plots for  16QAM and 32QAM are plotted by simulating the whole system:
Random input bits are generated
Then input signal is modulated.
Then AGWN is added
Received signal is demodulated.
Error is calculated.
Thus we ger BER.
